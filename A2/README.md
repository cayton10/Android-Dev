# Acivities and Intents

This was a simple exercise in using explicit / implicit intents to either open an activity from within the running application, or delegate to the Android OS the appropriate action to execute with accompanying data. It was a nice exercise to refamiliarize myself with C# and get used to actually start using Xamarin.

I can see where this can really start to take off with OOP methods, and I thoroughly enjoyed the design aspect of things. Placing customized XML files in the "drawable" directory for customizing controls like buttons and text fields, etc. It took me quite a while to get my bearings, but I'm looking forward to working more with this stack.
